#lorem-pixel

This is a simple [lorempixel] gallery that I'm using to test out MVP and some other libraries I find useful or want to try out. I'm also playing around with a few Android support libraries.

Libraries (for now)
---------

 * ButterKnife - http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife
 * Picasso - http://square.github.io/picasso
 * Retrolambda - https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda

TODO (not in order)
----
 * Screenshots
 * Unit tests and build flavors
 * Animations (shared element transitions, this is limitless)
 * Dagger (maybe)
 * Reactive Libraries (Rx*)
 * Some persistent storage (something different, with advantages, instead of just SQLiteOpenHelper)
